# Multi-organ/tissue radiation dosimetry in CT
The aim of this project was the development of a machine learning-based methodology for the automated personalized radiation dosimetry in CT.
The developed pipeline combines a robust organ segmentation tool ([TotalSegmentator](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator)) and dose prediction deep neural networks (DNNs) for the rapid and accurate estimation of radiation doses for 29 organs/tissues and subvolumes of the heart and lungs.

# Usage
This repository provides the necessary code for the development and implementation of the proposed methodology.
